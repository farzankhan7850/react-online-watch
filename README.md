### `Want to run it on your local system`

1. Node should be installed in your PC/Laptop. To check the node version, open the terminal and write 

         node --version

it should show some output like (node V.18.2.09), if not install it from node site [Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).


2. In terminal write , to check npm gets installed with node or not.

       npm --version 

3. Open a directory/folder where you want to download the code. Right click and open terminal there.
To make a copy of code in Terminal write

       git clone https://github.com/farzankhan7850/react-online-watch.git

      ![sample vid](https://github.com/farzankhan7850/react-counter/blob/main/tutorial.gif?raw=true)

4. Now a directory of folder is created with the name **react-counter**.    Open the folder, now open the terminal inside that folder or in the previous folder just write 

        cd react-counter

5. In terminal write **npm install** to install all depedencies.

        npm install

    (this will take few seconds)

6.  At last write 

         npm start

Now you are good to go.

THank you.
